# Prediction of co-crystals

This repository contains all the necessary codes and datasets that were used in a ML study for co-crystal prediction.

## Repository Contents

- `code/`: This directory contains all the source code used for ML modeling, data analysis, and generation of figures.(TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)
- `descriptors/`: This directory contains the code used for descriptors generation. (RDKit, mordred)
- `data/`: Here you'll find the datasets that were analyzed in the study, which include [SMILES of all data (test and training datasets, and independent dataset) and structural descriptors used for modeling].
